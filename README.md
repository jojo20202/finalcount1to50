# finalcount1to50
my notes contain the code used to do a count from 1 to 50 in bash. after many attemps of fail after fail, i was able to use

#!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq 1 50); do
  echo $i
done

this finaly worked in vim to complete in bash.

next issue was making sure this all updated to github through ssh.
